This is the first post on my new website. I have chosen to run it through GitHub pages. I have built the webpage with `jekyll`, which acts to 'compile' a webpage.

This webpage is built on the default 'minima' theme, but I took a lot of clues from [Nico Jourdain's website](https://nicojourdain.github.io). Thank you Nico!
